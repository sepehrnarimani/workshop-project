	\subsection{Repository Initialization and Commits}
	At first, I created a new folder in my computer using mkdir and then used git init command. I added README.md file and committed it. then I made 2 repositories to  add main.yml file, after adding that file, pasted your prepared file in my main.yml file and then committed it. I created a new repository in my github account and then used git remote add and then git push commands to push my repository in github.
	\subsection{ GitHub Actions for LaTeX Compilation}
	At first, I used your prepared yml file and added it to my repository, then after adding my .tex file to my repository and after committing it, I used "git tag v0.1.0" and pushed this tag to my repository. I saw my commit in Actions part in my repository in github.
